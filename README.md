# Your first assignment

Hi there. 

We are looking for great people that want to excel. Our motto is 'creating happy users', which basically means that we always try to create something that makes the end user really happy. That applies to everything from design to project management to development. A bug-free easy-to-use web application that is delivered in time and within budget is what we aim for. Sometimes we fail in some areas, but we always try our best.

Are you like that? Then write the best web application you can. 

## Background

Your local food store needs a very simple web based tool to keep track of their suppliers. 
They want to be able to add the suppliers with normal contact info, display them on a map and assign them to different categories depending on what kind of things they are delivering (milk, meat, bread etc.). The point of this is to be able to find efficient transport ways and have a nice list of suppliers if we need to contact them regarding deliveries.

Write this as a web application in the current version of Ruby on Rails.
